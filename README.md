# Detection-system-for-money-laundering-
In this project, We wil design a system to identify the suspicious transactions that might indicate money laundering.
With the help of Python and feature engineering and machine learning,we can detect anomalies in transaction data that may indicate money laundering. 
By feature engineering, we can develop features that highlight suspicious behavior, such as frequent transactions or amount variations. 
We will build a dashboard using tools like tableau or power BI. 
By integrating large data, we can detect money laundering.
